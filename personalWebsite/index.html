            <p>A math game I created as a project that utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery. The basic concept is to answer questions, and if correct you can cast spells at the enemy wizards.</p>

            <p>A counter I made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and vanilla DOM manipulation. Made added a small responsive feature for phones, so that you could add to the counter with the click of a button, rather than having to type it in.</p>
